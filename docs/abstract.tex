This thesis proposes a technical concept for a payment solution with which microservices can automatically charge each other for their provided services. The idea is motivated by the needs of cost transparency in large enterprises, as well as the applicability on decentralized web service marketplaces.\\

The proposed system is based on blockchain technologies and focuses on solving the performance and scalability issues that arise in conventional blockchain based systems. Therefore, a specialized state-channel approach was developed and a prototype was implemented to proof the concept and gain benchmark result. The prototype includes server and microservice client components, as well as a basic blockchain state and history inspection interface.\\

A strong focus is set on maintaining the trustlessness, security and decentralization properties, which are the largest benefits of a blockchain based solution, although these properties might not be required for all use-cases.\\

This work highly relates to general research about blockchain performance improvements, to cloud resource management and tracing, as well as to blockchain based machine-to-machine payment systems in other domains.
